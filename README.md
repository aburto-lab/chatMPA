# chatMPA: Marine Protection Assistant

chatMPA is an integrated digital assistant designed to support the management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). By bridging scientific evidence and policy actions, chatMPA facilitates the digitalization of information, centralizes multimodal data, and streamlines communication between researchers, decision-makers, and stakeholders.

## Overview

chatMPA is built with the objective of:
- Enhancing science–policy connectivity through automated management processes.
- Supporting MPAs with budget constraints by optimizing resource allocation and decision-making.
- Integrating data from diverse sources to monitor marine ecosystems in real time.
- Introducing a transparent data attribution system that assigns credit to original researchers.

## Identity and Vision

### Identity
chatMPA is a digital assistant tailored for MPAs. It serves as a management tool that:
- Automates updates to management plans.
- Generates budget proposals based on current ecological data.
- Collects and integrates data from sensors (cameras, hydrophones, videos), satellite imagery, and drone overpasses.
- Automates report generation and stakeholder communication.

### Vision
The vision of chatMPA is to transform marine conservation practices by:
- Establishing a seamless interface between scientific research and policy formulation.
- Increasing data maturity and operational efficiency within MPAs.
- Creating a new standard for data attribution that recognizes and quantifies scientific contributions through a novel “Impact Factor” metric.
